[Problem 1] Which boundary condition in particular gets better modeled as N increases, and why?
~~~
The boundary condition at y = 0 is better modeled as N 
increases.

This is because the Fourier sine series used in the potential 
approximation is constructed to match the condition 
V(x, 0) = V_0. As N increases, more sine modes are included, 
which allows the series to better approximate the features of 
the boundary condition which are not nearly smooth except at the
asymptote. 

This is visible in the graphs: higher N results in the potential
at y = 0 converging more closely to a flat plateau at V_0, while
lower N exhibits visible oscillations.

[Problem 2] State two things that quantitatively support that the field lines match the field you expect by taking minus the gradient.
~~~
1. Field lines are perpendicular to the boundary at y = 0:
   	Since the potential is constant on the bottom boundary 
   	(V(x, 0) = V_0), the gradient vector \nabla V must be 
	purely vertical at this edge. The field lines in all 
	four plots (N = 10, 20, 100, 100) rise vertically from 
	y \approx 0, confirming they follow -\nabla V. This is 
	especially clear at x = \frac{\pi}{2}, where the field 
	is symmetric and strongest.

2. Field lines compress and align with steep potential 
   gradients:
   	As N increases, the Fourier series captures sharper 
	spatial variation in the potential near x = 0 and x = L.	Correspondingly, the field lines bunch more tightly in 
	these regions and exhibit more curvature. This reflects 
	a stronger horizontal component of the electric field, 
	i.e. larger \left|-\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\right|,
	accurately matching the increasing spatial frequency of
	V. For example, the N=1000 plot shows more lines and 
	sharper bends near the edges than N=10, consistent with
	the steepening gradient. You can also see that low N
	has a bubbling effect induced by the ripples at the edge
	which are in line with the anticipated behavior.

[Problem 3b] Interpret the output from 3a: where are the biggest fractional errors, and why?
~~~

The largest fractional errors occur at the corners, near x = 0
and x = L for y = 0. This is due to a combination of smoothness
effects (the Gibbs Phenomenon) and the singularity of the 
\sinh\left( \frac{\pi y}{L} \right) function being in the
demoninator for small y in the exact solution.
