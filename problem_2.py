'''
Includes functions associated with problem 2, which reads:
    2. (Field lines.) Now switch to a 2D plot, showing the same
       part of the xy plane as in problem 1. Launch 50 uniformly
       spaced field lines from the y=0 boundary of the box.
       The field lines match the field you expect  by taking
       minus the gradient of your potential in problem 1.
       State two things tou observe about your field lines
       that (qualitatively) support this idea.
